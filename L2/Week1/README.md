## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

Quantitative finance is a field that I see an outside opportunity of breaking into. My majors include Math, Physics, and Finance, and these lend well
to the advanced quantitative skills that are needed in the quantitative finance space. Some notable coursework includes MATH 3302, 3304, 3313, 3311, 3315
and 4334. Noteable PHYS coursework includes 3344, and 4321. Other noteable coursework includes CS 1341, ACCT 2301, 2302 and FINA 3320. This Summer, I
am working on getting an internship in investment research for a high net worth individual capital advisory firm. I hope this experience will help me
develop my background in finance and can be a huge experience for a future Junior year internship. Overall, I am interested in quant finance because
I want to use complex math and algorithms to solve complicated financial problems and make a lot of money.

## 2. Career Goals

If I am unable to break into a good quant finance role, I would want to start out in similar math/finance roles like actuary, business valuation, data
science, ext. Ultimately, my biggest career goal is to get a really good 3rd, 4th, 5th job where I am towards the top of a company with opportunities
to make a big difference in the world and make a lot of money doing so. If I were to break into quant finance, I think I would be best suited in a 
quantitative research role with my physics background. I would take this route if I were able to be accepted to a really good mFin or phd/ms program
out of college. 

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

In my participation in the Alpha program, I want to improve my knowledge of coding and machine learning, as well as having a better understanding of different
software and what they can be used for. While I have a solid background in theoretical skills, I need to develop my practical skills if I want to have a shot
at landing a trading job in the future. Additionally, having and building a github profile will be helpful to my career development, and I hope this will be a 
great tool to help showcase some of my skills. Overall, this program fits into my learning path because I need to develop skills with technology in addition
to my more theoretical math/physics/finance coursework.

## 4. Current Technical Skills

Currently I would say that I am intermediate in Python, data analysis tools, and financial modeling. I would say that I am advanced in statistical and 
mathematical analysis. I would, however, say that I am a beginner in R and other programing languages, as well as machine learning.

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

Overall, I look to grow in my coding skills through real world projects and applications. I will do this by completing assignments and learning more ways
to utilize computational methods. I plan to track progress by looking at new knowledge I have aquired in the projects that I have completed. Overall, I plan to
spend about 2-5 hours a week on this club, as I do have a lot of other coursework and activities going on this semester, but I do hope that I will be able
to maximize my learning in the time I spend working on this program. Overall, I think this program will be a success if I am able to get a job utilizing
financial mathematics in the future.
